# Automated Generation of Gene Signatures
Gene expression signatures play a crucial role in comprehending the underlying molecular factors contributing to diseases and the impacts of pharmaceuticals. The manual extraction of gene expression signatures from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) has proven to be highly beneficial, contributing to drug repurposing efforts by suggesting novel drugs for various diseases and elucidating the mechanisms of action for approved drugs. Despite attempts to manually annotate GEO datasets, exemplified by projects like Gene Expression data Mining Toward Relevant Network Discovery (GEM-TREND), manual curation faces the challenge of scalability, limiting its coverage across the extensive array of available studies.

Consequently, there is a need to automate the process of generating gene signatures. One approach involves classifying samples within a dataset as either control or perturbation. In experimental settings, control serves as a confirmation that the experiment has successfully taken place. For instance, in drug treatment experiments, the control group may receive water or DMSO, while the perturbation group undergoes treatment with the drug.

The target variables for classification are the columns "ctrl" and "pert," which need accurate classification. Each row contains text that can be utilized to determine whether it is a control or perturbation. The data is distributed across multiple CSV files, with each file representing a dataset containing samples. In total, there are 20,000 samples, and metadata is provided for all of them, with actual manual curated labels available for 600 out of the 20,000 samples. The decision to label only a subset of the datasets underscores the importance of data, especially in situations where obtaining curated data is limited and costly, as exemplified by the case of chest x-rays. This underscores the fundamental principle of data-centric AI.
